# Description

###  ***Towers of Hanoi*** is an algorithm that solves a mathematical puzzle involving recursion.

####  The thrust of the problem/project is to move a stack of size-descending disks from one of three rods, rod A(left), over to Rod C(right).
  *  You can only move one disk at a time, starting with the top (smallest) disk on the stack. Stack logic (LIFO)
  *  All disks must be moved to Rod C and stacked with smallest disk on top descending to largest disk on bottom.
  *  The difficulty is that you cannot, in the process, stack a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.
  *  And you want to be efficient, executing the fewest moves possible.
  *  This problem is completed in Python3 and PyScript using recursion (can also be done iteratively), or in JavaScript, Ruby, C++, etc...

## General Information
   *  This project uses python3 to explain the logic of the game Towers of Hanoi
   *  The README.md includes an image of the game
   *  The README.md utilized the Markdown language syntax
   *  This project included the use of git (Bash/zsh) commands
   *  Adding favicons is not always seamless, the favicon image was generated by one site, but the code syntax is from another and then I modified it as well?!
     
 
   

## Technologies
   * This Project is created with/by:
   *  python3
   *  Utilizing Markdown language for the README.md content
   *  Visual Studio Code
   *  Using git commands in bash shell (zsh) terminal and GitHub
   *  HTML5
   *  CSS3
   *  favicon tab image generator
   *  Google
   *  look at the Towers of Hanoi pdf in the root directory - completed the game using 6 disks - took 90 moves though (optimal is 63) - try to beat it.
