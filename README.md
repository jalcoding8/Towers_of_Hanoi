# Description

###  ***Towers of Hanoi*** is an algorithm that solves a mathematical puzzle involving recursion.

####  The thrust of the problem/project is to move a stack of size-descending disks from one of three rods, rod A, over to Rod C.
  *  You can only move one disk at a time, starting with the top (smallest) disk on the stack.
  *  All disks must be moved to Rod C and stacked with smallest disk on top descending to largest disk on bottom.
  *  The difficulty is that you cannot, in the process, stack a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.
  *  And you want to be efficient, executing the fewest moves possible.
  *  This problem is completed in Python but can be done in JavaScript, Ruby, C++, etc...
